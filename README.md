This project explores the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to synthesize realistic pistachio images. By training the model on a dataset of pistachio images, the GAN learns to generate samples that visually resemble the original data. To assess the quality of these generated images, the Fr√©chet Inception Distance (FID) metric is used, allowing us to evaluate how closely the synthetic images match the real distribution. This work demonstrates the potential of GANs in image generation and provides a foundation for future improvements with more advanced architectures.
